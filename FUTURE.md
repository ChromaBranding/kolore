# Future versions of Kolore
After having some experience with Kolore and building a CMS, some ideas had showned up for future versions.

### Creation of modules
Some functionalities should be included as apart modules. For example:
	- Store module
	- Non admin login (for web users)

### CRUD API Based System
To ease web development, a more API based system should be developed.

### Define an object --> Get the CMS done
Every web has it's own personal requirement, but almost all share that are a very object centric programs.

Creating an object and defining it's characteristic should be enough to get the URLS created, the Database object and the view.
